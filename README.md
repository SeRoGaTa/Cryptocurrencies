# Cryptocurrencies

***Version 1.0.0***

## This analysis is intended to create a report for Accountability Accounting that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

On this analysis we preprocessed the data from CryptoCompare, then we apply PCA to reduce the data to 3 dimentions then we cluster it using K-means and at the end we vizualise the data using the 3D Scatter Plot as well as hvplot.scatter plot

Please find the complete analysis of the algorithms here [Crypto_clustering](https://github.com/SeRoGaTa/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/Challenge/crypto_clustering.ipynb) and the resources presented out of this folder [Resources](https://github.com/SeRoGaTa/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/Challenge/Resources)
